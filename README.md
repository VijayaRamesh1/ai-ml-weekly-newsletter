# AI/ML Weekly Newsletter

An automated newsletter that collects AI/ML news from RSS feeds, scores them using custom criteria, and publishes a weekly top 10.

## Features
- **Live RSS Collection**: Pulls articles from configurable sources
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Ranks by technical innovation, applicability, and business impact
- **Automated Pipeline**: GitHub Actions build and deploy weekly
- **GitHub Pages**: Live newsletter accessible via web

## How it works
1. **Collector** pulls articles from RSS feeds in `config/sources.yaml`
2. **Scorer** evaluates articles using weights in `config/weights.yaml`
3. **Builder** generates HTML newsletter from top 10 articles
4. **GitHub Actions** automatically deploys to GitHub Pages
